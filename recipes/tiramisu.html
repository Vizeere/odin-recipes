<h1>Tiramisu</h1>


<p><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups strong brewed coffee, cooled to room temperature</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons coffee liqueur (such as Kahlua), optional</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>24-30 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)</li>
    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Method</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well combined.</li>
    <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes pale yellow, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the bowl from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Whisk in the mascarpone cheese until smooth and well combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a shallow dish, combine the brewed coffee and coffee liqueur (if using).</li>
    <li>Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture briefly, making sure not to soak them too much.</li>
    <li>Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, smoothing it out evenly.</li>
    <li>Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the tiramisu to set.</li>
    <li>Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
    <li>Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
